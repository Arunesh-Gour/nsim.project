NSIM - Documents
****************
This directory contains documents regarding NSIM.

Presentation
============
The presentation (`presentation.nsim.pdf <https://github.com/Arunesh-Gour/nsim.project/blob/main/docs/presentation.nsim.pdf>`_) is designed to easily introduce
NSIM project to anyone while showcasing its features and usage.

This presentation is designed using ``Google Slides`` from scratch, and is
compiled using ``GhostScript``, ``pdfunite`` and other tools on
``Ubuntu 22.04``.
This is because ``Google Slides`` was unable to process the load of the
presentation during conversion to PDF.

The PDF format is chosen to maintain the exact representation (as intended) on
all systems. Though a view-only presentation, hosted on Google Slides, can be
found from the following link:

`https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YIXVtQKLPQam75sSqL-FD2_XsLxih1gvh9nfGWzZAHo/edit?usp=sharing <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YIXVtQKLPQam75sSqL-FD2_XsLxih1gvh9nfGWzZAHo/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
