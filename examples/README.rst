NSIM - Examples
***************
This directory contains some example scripts for using NSIM.

Usage
=====
Before running these scripts, make sure that either ``nsim`` (or a copy of
`src/nsim/ <https://github.com/Arunesh-Gour/nsim.project/blob/main/src/nsim/>`_
) is present in python's path, or make clone of `src/nsim/ <https://github.com/Arunesh-Gour/nsim.project/blob/main/src/nsim/>`_ and store it in your project
directory.

Then, run examples simply as ``python example.py``.
